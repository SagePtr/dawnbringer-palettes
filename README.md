# DawnBringer Palettes

As someone with limited artistic ability, using a nice, limited collection of colors helps me create decent looking web sites and games without agonizing over the color choices.

These palettes were created by [DawnBringer][2], a user on the [Pixel Joint][1] forums:

* [DB16 - DawnBringer's 16 Col Palette v1.0][3]
* [DB32 - DawnBringer's 32 Col Palette V1.0][4]

This repository contains the DawnBringer palettes in various formats for use across many platforms.
